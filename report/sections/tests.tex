We are now evaluating the behavior of the $\LT$ and $H^1$ velocity errors, as well as the $\LT$ pressure error, on various meshes as the mesh size decreases.\footnote{Linear slope will be represented in \textcolor{solarized-green}{green}, quadratic slope in \textcolor{solarized-blue}{blue}, and cubic slope in \textcolor{solarized-red}{red}.}

\subsection{Polynomial fits}

Here are the results for the polynomial fits. Given the relatively high pressure error on the initial mesh, an additional fit is performed solely on the tail.
